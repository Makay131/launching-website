## Project Title

Launching Website

## Project Description

This is a project in which there is a fully landing page basically counting down the time until the date of the initial website launch.

The company logo, banner-type titles, and a count-down timer with a learn more button are the main components of the page. Also there is a rocket animation going on in the background.

When the page gets loaded there is a small loading animation where a timer starts from 0 and goes to 100%. Then it fades away to let the landing page emerge smoothly.

## Technologies Used
